# Iris Classification with Streamlit

This project is a simple Streamlit web app that classifies Iris flower species using a Random Forest Classifier. The app uses the popular Iris dataset and allows users to input the features of the flower (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) to predict the species.

## Features

- **Interactive sliders**: Users can adjust the values for sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width to see the classification prediction.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: The model is trained on the Iris dataset using a Random Forest Classifier and predicts the species based on input features.

## Installation

To run this app locally, you need to have Python 3.6+ installed. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-classification.git
   cd iris-classification
